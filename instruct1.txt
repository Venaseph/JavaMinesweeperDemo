- You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others 
  don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all
  the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.

- Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares 
  containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.

- To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a 
  bomb, point and right-click.
