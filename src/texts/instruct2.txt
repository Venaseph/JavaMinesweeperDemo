- A squares "neighbors" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 
  diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The 
  board does not wrap around the edges.

- If you open a square with zero neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically 
  open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.

- To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.

- You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
